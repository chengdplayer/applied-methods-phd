1. value of randomization and its debate
2. Research design and design-based inference

Randomization
1. randomized intervention breaks paths on DAG
2. randomization creates independence necessary for strong ignorability
3. randomization creates some forms of independenmce between intervention and structural errors in a model

 credibility revolution
 Research design approach
 
What is research design
a statistical/economic statement of how an empirical research paper will estimate a relationship between two variables that is causal in nature
the design should have a description for some variation in X either caused by or approximated by a random experiment

We assume we have a randomized intervention
1. ignore compliance
2. ignore quasi-experimentation
3. details in Bowers and Leavitt (2020)

Knowledge of an explicit and randomized design provide a different approach to estimation and testing

Design-based inference is 
1. transparent
2. efficient

Define the research design
1. \omega denotes the space of possible values that treatment vector can take
2.  under some assumptions (random assignment is equal across \omega) that this estimator is unbiased
Payoff 
1. with research design, we can produce strong hypothesis testing than the traditional one
2. when design is complicated, we can use randomized inference

problem: focusing on internal validity suffers from focusing too little on external validity. very little has been discussed on the population
